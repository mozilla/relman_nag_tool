We're reaching out to you because there are bugs with unfixed changes that are tracked as also affecting the upcoming ESR 10.0.6 (Shipping with FF14) which need your attention.

Please take a look at the following bugs and, where applicable, nominate patches for mozilla-beta as well as ESR branch landing, update status flags, and/or land approved patches.

NOTE: Anything requiring mozilla-beta approval/landing is first priority, since we'd like the ready fixes to land in our next Beta, going to build Tuesday 6/26.
